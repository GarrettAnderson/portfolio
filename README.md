# Portfolio
Portfolio of my development projects.

## Description

This is the beginning of a professional portfolio. The images in the my work section are placeholders because I have no applications from class to include at the moment. I have just named the projects Project 01, Project 02 etc. since there are no applications to show at the moment.

## Installation

Just need to download the source files from the github repository onto local. Open repository in VSCode and right click on index.html file and select "Open with Live Server". 

## Usage
