# portfolio
Portfolio of my development projects.

## Description

This is the beginning of a professional portfolio. The images in the my work section are placeholders because I have no applications from class to include at the moment. I have just named the projects Project 01, Project 02 etc. since there are no applications to show at the moment.

## Installation

Just need to download the source files from the github repository onto local. Open repository in VSCode and right click on index.html file and select "Open with Live Server". 

## Usage

The portfolio site is to be a represetnation of work I have accomplished. Currently there are placeholder images that can be clicked in order to navigate user to the Github repo for this project. 

The links in the contact me section will navigate user to my Github profile and LinkedIn profile.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
